    Write a Python script that takes in a URL and an email,
    sends a POST request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter,
    and displays the body of the response (decoded in utf-8)

    - The email must be sent in the email variable
    - You must use the packages urllib and sys
    - You are not allowed to import packages other than urllib and sys
    - You donâ€™t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
    - You must use the with statement
    - Please test your script in the sandbox provided, using the
        web server running on port 5000

    Example:
        guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x11$ ./2-post_email.py http://0.0.0.0:5000/post_email hr@holbertonschool.com
        Your email is: hr@holbertonschool.com
